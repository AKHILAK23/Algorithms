# Contributing
You can contribute to this repo in any of the following ways
## Adding new Algorithms

* If you are submitting an algorithm using already existing language,
  * Add it to the respective folder 
  * Make a folder with the name as name of algorithm
  * Algorithms must be properly indented and explained with comments

* If you are submitting an algorithm in a new language not in the repo
  * Make a folder with name as name of the language.
  * Should have 2 files: `problem.md` and `solution`
  * In `problem.md`, provide detailed explanation of problem statement and constraints with at least 2 testcases and it's explanation
  * Add your algorithm in a folder specified by its name inside the language folder.
  * Algorithms must be properly indented and explained with comments

## Adding solutions to existing problems
* You can contribute to any existing algorithms.
* Add it as a new file in the format algorithm_name_number eg: (`Binary_search_2`) in the respective existing algorithm folder
* Algorithm must be properly indented and explained with comments

## Documentation Contributions
* You can improve the readme and contributing documentation

## Important Note: READ THIS BEFORE SENDING A Pull Request

The idea is to collect different algorithms in different languages.

As long as your PR adheres with all the points mentioned above, you're good to go :sparkles:
